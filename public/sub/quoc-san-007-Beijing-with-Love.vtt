3
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.364
I thought I could kill

4
00:41:46.543 --> 00:41:47.702
with somebody's hand

5
00:41:48.244 --> 00:41:50.543
But the plan failed

6
00:41:50.914 --> 00:41:51.938
Have you received my order?

7
00:41:52.648 --> 00:41:54.514
How can you make your
own decision?

8
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:57.943
I know!

9
00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.849
I do hope to understand Chai

10
00:42:00.023 --> 00:42:01.012
Shut up

11
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.956
Who do you think you're
to raise this question?

12
00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:05.391
What is he, that's none
of your business

13
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:10.061
Remember, your mom &
dad were betrayers

14
00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:11.222
Your grandpa was a traitor

15
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.391
So you're a traitor

16
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.936
It's fate

17
00:42:16.206 --> 00:42:17.467
If I didn't let you stay with me,

18
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.775
you would have been
executed with them

19
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.177
Your life is mine

20
00:42:22.612 --> 00:42:24.340
So you'd obey my order

21
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.838
Is that clear?

22
00:42:29.885 --> 00:42:34.846
Kam I know you may
be kind-hearted

23
00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:37.753
You know what he is now?

24
00:42:38.461 --> 00:42:40.088
He's a beast

25
00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:42.429
He was a nasty guy

26
00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:46.762
Raped the pregnant woman
& the little girls

27
00:42:48.103 --> 00:42:50.436
Look, the girls and so small

28
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.536
These pregnant women are big

29
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.405
They were dragged
to death by Chai

30
00:42:55.579 --> 00:42:57.342
Not only for me

31
00:42:57.813 --> 00:42:59.610
But also for the public

32
00:43:00.182 --> 00:43:00.911
Any questions?

33
00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:01.981
No

34
00:43:02.284 --> 00:43:04.583
OK, let's do as our plan

35
00:43:04.753 --> 00:43:06.516
Kill him in Lai Yau Wai's home

36
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:07.748
Got it

37
00:43:21.036 --> 00:43:22.025
Are you alright?

38
00:43:22.472 --> 00:43:23.166
What does that mean?

39
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.103
Nothing, I think, you've
locked up for a long time,

40
00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:27.467
and you didn't answer me

41
00:43:27.643 --> 00:43:29.509
That's why I just broke in
and watched

42
00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:31.942
Are you bathing?

43
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:33.710
Yes, I'm fine

44
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.981
Please close the door

45
00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:41.418
I can't imagine that'd happened

46
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.751
I said, get out & close the door

47
00:43:44.159 --> 00:43:45.592
Yes... well... I'm sorry...

48
00:43:45.762 --> 00:43:49.253
Get out!

49
00:43:53.737 --> 00:43:54.362
What do you want?

50
00:43:54.538 --> 00:43:55.163
Give it or not?

51
00:43:55.338 --> 00:43:55.996
What?

52
00:43:56.172 --> 00:43:56.900
Money for the dead

53
00:43:57.072 --> 00:43:57.766
For the dead?

54
00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.599
Tak's dad

55
00:43:58.775 --> 00:43:59.536
Who's Tak's dad?

56
00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:01.733
The innocent one who was shot
dead in the shopping centre

57
00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:03.943
Donate money for the dead?

58
00:44:04.614 --> 00:44:05.045
Can we give Tak's family

59
00:44:05.215 --> 00:44:06.409
through the press?

60
00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:07.612
Maybe

61
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.210
What name should we write?
The kind-hearted guys?

62
00:44:10.887 --> 00:44:11.682
Up to you

63
00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:13.722
Since we're not close friends!

64
00:44:13.889 --> 00:44:15.824
Just donate $500, that's enough

65
00:44:16.726 --> 00:44:17.623
Up to you

66
00:44:17.994 --> 00:44:19.358
Can you pay that $500 for me?

67
00:44:19.528 --> 00:44:20.586
What?

68
00:44:20.896 --> 00:44:22.659
When I finish the mission,
I'll be awarded $500

69
00:44:22.831 --> 00:44:23.695
So I can pay you back

70
00:44:23.867 --> 00:44:24.798
What?

71
00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:27.492
Trust me! I won't forget my words

72
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.371
Alright

73
00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:27.487
Put it properly...

74
00:45:27.664 --> 00:45:30.257
Go... again

75
00:45:30.934 --> 00:45:33.869
Again

76
00:45:34.603 --> 00:45:36.161
This is dangerous explosive

77
00:45:36.873 --> 00:45:38.737
Watch this day & night

78
00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:39.838
Yes

79
00:45:53.322 --> 00:45:55.119
Lai Yau Wai always deals
with smuggling

80
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:57.384
The lost cranium of dinosaur
maybe related to him

81
00:45:57.559 --> 00:45:58.686
That's him

82
00:45:58.862 --> 00:45:59.954
Take action when there's
a chance

83
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.097
Any more questions?

84
00:46:01.431 --> 00:46:05.197
Yes, is Lee Heung Lan
your mom?

85
00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:07.927
As I know, she's a traitor

86
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:11.969
Sorry, I've no question

87
00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:13.608
Time's up. Let's go

88
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.135
Kam, if we finish the
mission tonight

89
00:46:17.313 --> 00:46:18.143
I'll return at once

90
00:46:18.313 --> 00:46:19.041
So, tell me what you like

91
00:46:19.215 --> 00:46:20.181
I'll send it to you

92
00:46:20.483 --> 00:46:20.880
No, thanks

93
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.949
I've to send you a gift!

94
00:46:22.117 --> 00:46:23.050
White roses

95
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.148
You're very romantic

96
00:46:25.722 --> 00:46:26.653
Maybe, I'll send it to you

97
00:46:26.822 --> 00:46:28.313
Very romantic

98
00:46:30.793 --> 00:46:32.284
If we've time,

99
00:46:32.762 --> 00:46:34.855
I'd like to visit the karaoke
in Hong Kong

100
00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:36.789
I'll keep contact with you

101
00:46:38.001 --> 00:46:38.762
You know,

102
00:46:38.934 --> 00:46:41.199
my voice is like Jacky Cheung

103
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:42.860
My Adam's apple can
move up & down!

104
00:46:43.039 --> 00:46:43.902
This is the key of the rear door

105
00:46:44.074 --> 00:46:45.132
Hurry up, or you'll have no time

106
00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:46.804
I'll sing you a song

107
00:46:47.177 --> 00:46:48.371
Why not "Lee Heung Lan"?

108
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:49.675
I tell you,

109
00:46:50.045 --> 00:46:51.411
I'm forced to stay with you

110
00:46:51.581 --> 00:46:52.980
Don't mention Lee Heung Lan
in front of me

111
00:46:53.148 --> 00:46:54.081
Don't sing in front of me

112
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.945
I don't want to hear your bull shit!

113
00:46:59.121 --> 00:47:01.784
I appreciate your straight character!

114
00:47:04.927 --> 00:47:06.485
This key is not important to me

115
00:47:06.896 --> 00:47:08.726
This is not a simple box

116
00:47:08.898 --> 00:47:10.762
This is a special box
called "Magic Box"

117
00:47:10.934 --> 00:47:12.458
It can send me

118
00:47:12.635 --> 00:47:14.068
to Lai's home safely
& beautifully

119
00:47:16.706 --> 00:47:22.610
Magic Box!

120
00:47:25.949 --> 00:47:27.177
Why are you here?
What do you want?

121
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:29.483
I'd ask you that question!

122
00:47:30.018 --> 00:47:30.916
Oh shit!

123
00:47:31.454 --> 00:47:32.045
I haven't adjusted the angle

124
00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:33.586
So, wrong direction

125
00:47:34.623 --> 00:47:35.420
Now, it's OK

126
00:47:38.027 --> 00:47:40.018
Magic... Shit!

127
00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.264
The door is opened. Go in

128
00:47:48.338 --> 00:47:50.135
Kam, I am not fool...

129
00:47:50.306 --> 00:47:51.170
Clean the blood first

130
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.534
Alright

131
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.371
I think this box
is wrong positioned!

132
00:47:55.744 --> 00:47:56.711
Adjust it, that'll be alright

133
00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:00.742
Don't waste my time!

134
00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:02.474
It'll be alright!
Give me one more chance

135
00:48:04.219 --> 00:48:09.282
Magic Box...

136
00:48:22.472 --> 00:48:23.768
Excuse me,
Dry Martine please

137
00:48:33.248 --> 00:48:34.943
What're you looking?
Give me another the glass

138
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:39.152
That's too much!
What're you looking?

139
00:48:43.726 --> 00:48:45.250
Chai, how is it going?

140
00:48:46.295 --> 00:48:49.197
Dangerous!
The guests look so nasty!

141
00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:50.559
But very kind!

142
00:48:50.733 --> 00:48:52.063
You won't understand!

143
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.059
Sir, how about you?

144
00:48:55.972 --> 00:48:57.268
I'll take care myself, thanks

145
00:49:09.918 --> 00:49:10.851
Mr. Lai, your call!

146
00:49:13.088 --> 00:49:14.077
Hello?

147
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.867
Target discovered

148
00:49:40.148 --> 00:49:42.878
Pay attention, the cranium...

149
00:49:45.889 --> 00:49:48.152
Listen, I'll say once more

150
00:49:48.657 --> 00:49:52.219
Put the bones into hot water
to remove extra fats

151
00:49:52.394 --> 00:49:54.726
That cook it with fish
snout for an hour

152
00:49:54.898 --> 00:49:56.057
When will you come back
for the soup?

153
00:49:56.398 --> 00:50:00.391
Cut the crap!
My wife is inside

154
00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:01.632
Romario sent it to Pai Bi-to

155
00:50:01.804 --> 00:50:02.896
Pai Bi-to scored with

156
00:50:03.072 --> 00:50:05.130
his wonderful skill

157
00:50:09.445 --> 00:50:11.275
Chai, how is it?
Can't you listen?

158
00:50:14.317 --> 00:50:14.748
We believed that a man called

159
00:50:14.918 --> 00:50:16.646
Pai Bi-to stole the cranium

160
00:50:17.085 --> 00:50:18.882
Then he used his
personal skills...

161
00:50:19.054 --> 00:50:20.317
Shoot & score one mark

162
00:50:20.822 --> 00:50:22.016
But the signal is weak here

163
00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.521
I'm planning to dig a tunnel

164
00:50:24.693 --> 00:50:25.557
towards his sofa

165
00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:26.956
And to hear what he'll say

166
00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:29.394
Chai, cut the crap!

167
00:50:29.766 --> 00:50:31.494
Go to some place else
which receives better

168
00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:34.833
Kam, radio receiver is
being disturbed there

169
00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:35.967
I can't hear

170
00:50:36.139 --> 00:50:37.503
the words of Lai Yau Wai

171
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:41.905
Chat

172
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.144
try a place which is not crowded

173
00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:47.077
In front of me

174
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.273
there is a piano only

175
00:50:53.021 --> 00:50:54.148
Go & try

176
00:50:55.157 --> 00:50:55.954
Alright

177
00:51:07.003 --> 00:51:08.163
Not clear at all

178
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.161
Don't move, sit well

179
00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:14.007
Right

180
00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:18.809
I feel embarrass
to sit here alone

181
00:51:19.114 --> 00:51:20.547
You love singing songs?

182
00:51:20.717 --> 00:51:21.740
Sing

183
00:51:22.952 --> 00:51:24.646
Alright!

184
00:51:55.784 --> 00:51:56.682
I forgot the lyrics

185
00:52:54.143 --> 00:52:55.576
How is it?

186
00:52:56.311 --> 00:52:57.244
Normal, not special

187
00:52:57.713 --> 00:52:59.681
Like Jacky Cheung or not?

188
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:00.949
Fair!

189
00:53:12.795 --> 00:53:14.193
You're really great!

190
00:53:19.601 --> 00:53:21.536
You're great to change position
in such short time!

191
00:53:21.704 --> 00:53:24.103
You're somebody, I guess

192
00:53:24.273 --> 00:53:25.706
Be frank

193
00:53:26.409 --> 00:53:28.740
I'm waiting a very
important man

194
00:53:29.244 --> 00:53:31.213
I think, you know him too

195
00:53:34.317 --> 00:53:36.648
Sorry, no comment

196
00:53:37.487 --> 00:53:39.318
I won't force others

197
00:53:39.922 --> 00:53:42.014
But I've something to tell you

198
00:53:42.824 --> 00:53:44.416
I really appreciate you

199
00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:11.016
I love you

200
00:54:58.934 --> 00:55:01.233
Got it? Here is very dangerous

201
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:02.969
I don't know where
the killers are hiding!

202
00:55:22.592 --> 00:55:23.889
Will that be so beneficial?

203
00:56:04.666 --> 00:56:05.565
I was shot

204
00:56:08.304 --> 00:56:09.793
How can you walk freely then?

205
00:56:11.273 --> 00:56:12.501
Luckily I've put on
bullet-proof vest

206
00:56:13.809 --> 00:56:15.106
But no bullet-proof trousers

207
00:56:23.052 --> 00:56:24.041
This is for you

208
00:56:25.353 --> 00:56:27.014
Where do you get it from?

209
00:56:27.623 --> 00:56:29.021
I got it while I was escaping!

210
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:31.489
This is rare!
You're really lucky

211
00:56:43.505 --> 00:56:45.996
Don't be so serious! Nuts!

212
00:56:46.675 --> 00:56:49.201
How do you know that?
Many people say so

213
00:56:49.679 --> 00:56:50.976
The killers of the Man
with a Golden Gun are inside

214
00:56:51.146 --> 00:56:52.204
Go now

215
00:56:57.585 --> 00:56:58.416
Who is he?

216
00:57:06.262 --> 00:57:08.253
I'm here, don't worry

217
00:57:09.664 --> 00:57:10.494
Cripple, sit here

218
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:11.632
Let me handle it

219
00:57:20.775 --> 00:57:22.141
Bump him to death

220
00:57:31.786 --> 00:57:32.913
You're lucky to escape!

221
00:57:51.606 --> 00:57:52.436
How are you?

222
00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:56.041
Bandage and cotton,
any scissors?

223
00:58:04.253 --> 00:58:05.184
Yes

224
00:58:18.067 --> 00:58:18.829
I can't get any scissors

225
00:58:19.135 --> 00:58:19.896
Forget it

226
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:25.639
The bullet is shot into
the bone of my thigh

227
00:58:26.208 --> 00:58:27.606
And it's pressing my artery

228
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:29.476
which locates near the trigeminal

229
00:58:30.746 --> 00:58:32.646
My left brain is lacking oxygen

230
00:58:33.148 --> 00:58:34.309
And the right part of my body
is starting to be palsy

231
00:58:36.418 --> 00:58:38.853
I've to cut the wound and
take out the bullet

232
00:58:43.925 --> 00:58:45.085
Let me do it

233
00:58:52.333 --> 00:58:54.666
This is a famous knife

234
00:58:54.836 --> 00:58:56.565
which is used by a famous smith

235
00:58:56.739 --> 00:58:58.434
It's made by special iron

236
00:58:59.041 --> 00:59:01.838
Net weight 40 catties
16 tales and 4 oz

237
00:59:02.143 --> 00:59:03.702
It's not easy to be taken
by ordinary people

238
00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:08.143
It needs special skill

239
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:10.885
In order not to contact
the nerves and vessels,

240
00:59:12.121 --> 00:59:13.179
help me to widen the wound

241
00:59:14.657 --> 00:59:15.487
Hold it

242
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.155
I can stand it

243
00:59:18.494 --> 00:59:19.518
Can't you see the bullet?

244
00:59:20.628 --> 00:59:21.356
The black one?

245
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.554
No, that's trash

246
00:59:23.731 --> 00:59:24.789
Higher

247
00:59:25.333 --> 00:59:25.856
The white one?

248
00:59:26.034 --> 00:59:27.059
That's bone

249
00:59:27.235 --> 00:59:28.760
The silver one is the bullet

250
00:59:29.771 --> 00:59:30.362
I see it

251
00:59:30.539 --> 00:59:31.597
It's clipped deep inside

252
00:59:35.376 --> 00:59:36.275
Dig it out

253
00:59:36.778 --> 00:59:37.403
What?

254
00:59:37.813 --> 00:59:38.710
Go ahead

255
00:59:38.981 --> 00:59:39.742
Like this?

256
00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:41.014
Yes

257
00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:42.280
Do you need anesthetic?

258
00:59:42.885 --> 00:59:43.543
Yes

259
00:59:45.688 --> 00:59:46.585
Turn on the video

260
00:59:52.494 --> 00:59:53.085
Have you put a wrong tape?

261
00:59:53.262 --> 00:59:56.856
No, this is called
"Shifting attention"

262
00:59:57.166 --> 00:59:58.496
You mean it's the stance of making love?

263
00:59:58.666 --> 00:59:59.827
You want to cheat me?

264
01:00:00.469 --> 01:00:01.800
I mean this is the way
I use as anesthetic!

265
01:00:02.403 --> 01:00:04.871
Have you read the story of Wah Tor,
the greatest doctor of China

266
01:00:06.942 --> 01:00:08.068
Once Kwan Wan Cheung

267
01:00:08.244 --> 01:00:10.677
was playing chess during an operation

268
01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.313
Now, I am going to
watch blue tape

269
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:15.242
under an operation too

270
01:00:15.717 --> 01:00:16.547
Go ahead

271
01:00:18.887 --> 01:00:19.855
Watch it later

272
01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:21.150
Alright

273
01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:31.365
The bullet is too closed
to the bone,

274
01:00:31.534 --> 01:00:32.465
nerves are around

275
01:00:32.635 --> 01:00:33.659
It hurts, hold it

276
01:00:33.835 --> 01:00:34.824
Black too?

277
01:00:42.311 --> 01:00:43.208
Why do you stop?

278
01:00:45.581 --> 01:00:47.811
I want my blood to concentrate
to one part intentionally

279
01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:49.347
I don't want to lose
much blood

280
01:00:49.684 --> 01:00:51.083
Forget it, just go ahead

281
01:00:51.719 --> 01:00:52.777
It's blocking my operation

282
01:00:52.954 --> 01:00:54.012
Why don't you move it aside?

283
01:00:57.559 --> 01:00:58.219
Yeah! Come on

284
01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:00.657
Use more force...

285
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:02.126
What? Do you feel pain?

286
01:01:02.864 --> 01:01:03.626
I am not talking to you

287
01:01:03.798 --> 01:01:05.266
I am talking to the darkie

288
01:01:06.268 --> 01:01:07.097
Sorry... Sorry

289
01:01:08.369 --> 01:01:09.166
So much blood

290
01:01:10.605 --> 01:01:12.369
You broke a vessel

291
01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:13.530
What'll I do?

292
01:01:14.943 --> 01:01:16.240
Go on watching the tape

293
01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:32.527
Can you hold it?

294
01:01:34.362 --> 01:01:36.626
Chat with me,
ask me some questions

295
01:01:37.231 --> 01:01:38.722
Don't let me sleep

296
01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:41.193
I am afraid I won't wake up
after sleeping

297
01:01:43.472 --> 01:01:44.961
What's your name?

298
01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:46.800
I am called Ling Ling Chai

299
01:01:47.675 --> 01:01:48.835
You may ask some
difficult questions

300
01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:51.300
Difficult?

301
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.782
There is a farm, the number of
chicken is 4 times of the duck

302
01:01:56.117 --> 01:01:58.483
The quantity of ducks is 9
less than the quantity of pigs

303
01:01:59.054 --> 01:02:01.215
The total quantity of
pig and duck is 67

304
01:02:01.623 --> 01:02:04.092
How many legs do the animals

305
01:02:04.259 --> 01:02:05.282
in the farm have?

306
01:02:05.994 --> 01:02:06.893
Let me ask you

307
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.757
Alright

308
01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:15.132
Who is the man and
the woman of the picture?

309
01:02:19.074 --> 01:02:20.132
My parents

310
01:02:20.943 --> 01:02:22.068
Why can't we see their face?

311
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:26.012
When I was small, they died

312
01:02:26.382 --> 01:02:27.541
so I don't have much memory

313
01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:30.077
Oh, I'm sorry

314
01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:32.184
We are orphans

315
01:02:32.655 --> 01:02:34.144
that's why we can
make friends with each other

316
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:36.586
Kim

317
01:02:39.628 --> 01:02:40.652
Thank you

318
01:02:44.733 --> 01:02:45.757
Don't mention it

319
01:02:46.268 --> 01:02:47.496
Hold it, don't die

320
01:02:51.039 --> 01:02:52.701
Can you turn off
the air condition?

321
01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.001
I feel cold

322
01:03:56.905 --> 01:03:57.929
Chai

323
01:04:00.976 --> 01:04:05.072
Chai...

324
01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:06.880
Luckily, I've practised
Chinese Therapy

325
01:04:10.052 --> 01:04:11.451
But about disinfection
and stop bleeding...

326
01:04:13.088 --> 01:04:15.181
This is so wonderful!

327
01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:40.273
.224 Tiny Spittoon Bullet?

328
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:42.282
It's only used by you

329
01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:46.246
Where is your UFO Rifle?

330
01:04:47.523 --> 01:04:49.184
It must be put on the car outside?

331
01:04:55.764 --> 01:04:58.630
In fact, it's you who shot me

332
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.507
Since you have to kill me,
why did you save me?

333
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:20.211
What's the relationship between
you and the man with a golden gun?

334
01:05:20.389 --> 01:05:22.117
You needn't ask,
I won't tell anything

335
01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:23.952
Being a spy,
I can't kill you,

336
01:05:24.425 --> 01:05:25.483
so there is only one result

337
01:05:25.827 --> 01:05:26.590
Come on

338
01:05:38.873 --> 01:05:39.568
Alright

339
01:05:47.014 --> 01:05:48.003
You can't make it in
such a short distance!

340
01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:51.112
Poor aiming

341
01:05:54.322 --> 01:05:55.221
I can't help

342
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.925
About killing and fighting,
don't bother me anymore

343
01:06:03.297 --> 01:06:04.458
I'd better watch my tape

344
01:06:17.045 --> 01:06:18.170
Just pretend that
I've never seen you

345
01:06:39.967 --> 01:06:43.630
Chai, don't go,
you can't go back

346
01:06:44.072 --> 01:06:45.333
Commander is the man
with the golden gun

347
01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:46.838
The dinosaur's...

348
01:06:48.844 --> 01:06:49.936
Why are you taller?

349
01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:53.536
You told the truth at last

350
01:06:59.086 --> 01:07:00.952
You look thinner!

351
01:07:01.422 --> 01:07:04.358
It's not easy to be a betrayer, isn't it?

352
01:07:14.503 --> 01:07:16.630
Miss, do you have any plaster?

353
01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:18.773
You look so lovely

354
01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:21.902
I know why Commander Chan
was killed by you now

355
01:07:22.177 --> 01:07:23.644
I want to see your Commander

356
01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:25.608
Please show we the way

357
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.858
You know, Siu Kam
betrayed our country

358
01:07:47.402 --> 01:07:48.391
I don't know

359
01:07:48.737 --> 01:07:51.137
Our country trusts her
so much and she...

360
01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:52.565
Who beat you up?

361
01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:54.367
I think it's done by the man
with a golden gun

362
01:07:54.742 --> 01:07:56.266
Where is Siu Kam?
Where is she?

363
01:07:56.445 --> 01:07:57.605
I don't know, she lost

364
01:07:59.847 --> 01:08:00.541
So careless!

365
01:08:00.715 --> 01:08:03.514
The enemy is too cunning,
they appear everywhere!

366
01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:06.117
How is your wound?

367
01:08:06.288 --> 01:08:07.413
It'll be alright

368
01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:09.215
You are bleeding!

369
01:08:10.025 --> 01:08:13.119
Sign this, and go to the hospital
for treatment

370
01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:14.492
It's urgent!

371
01:08:14.663 --> 01:08:15.561
Guard. Yes

372
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.560
Send him to the hospital now

373
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:18.893
You needn't worry much

374
01:08:20.969 --> 01:08:21.765
This way, please

375
01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:52.530
What are you looking,
come on

376
01:08:52.833 --> 01:08:53.765
We are waiting for you

377
01:08:54.735 --> 01:08:55.725
Why an execution now?

378
01:08:56.505 --> 01:08:57.198
Let's choose some other ways

379
01:08:57.372 --> 01:08:58.532
No, we have arrived

380
01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:06.076
So serious!

381
01:09:07.114 --> 01:09:09.515
What's the matter?

382
01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:10.715
Nothing

383
01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:12.347
You mean nothing?

384
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.585
I am in trouble now

385
01:09:13.954 --> 01:09:15.615
Don't move

386
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:17.680
If anything happens,
tell me clearly first

387
01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:18.756
Go

388
01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:23.128
Ling Ling Chai, you signed and
you admitted that you're a betrayer

389
01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:25.829
You stole our country's treasure
which deserved a capital punishment

390
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.527
You'll be executed now

391
01:09:32.306 --> 01:09:33.103
Go back

392
01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:35.502
Wait, I am innocent...

393
01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:36.904
Wait, I am innocent...

394
01:09:37.412 --> 01:09:38.902
I didn't see any
national confidential

395
01:09:39.581 --> 01:09:41.742
You should have conscience!

396
01:09:42.884 --> 01:09:44.442
Everybody knows
I am a blind man

397
01:09:45.554 --> 01:09:47.020
You framed a blind

398
01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.823
to read national confidential
unlawfully?

399
01:09:55.564 --> 01:09:57.725
Pal, I am a good friend
of Commissioner Chan

400
01:09:57.899 --> 01:09:58.694
I always have meals
together with him

401
01:09:58.867 --> 01:10:02.097
Wait... Wait...

402
01:10:03.404 --> 01:10:04.632
My dad is Commissioner Chan

403
01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:06.671
If you kill me,
I will ask him to kill you

404
01:10:06.841 --> 01:10:07.967
Ready

405
01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:14.176
No... no

406
01:10:15.283 --> 01:10:18.377
I am so smart

407
01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:22.890
I don't want to die

408
01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:30.893
No, no...

409
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.667
Damn!

410
01:10:37.338 --> 01:10:38.327
What an ugly face!

411
01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:40.967
So ugly!

412
01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:43.978
Good shot

413
01:10:44.145 --> 01:10:45.306
Yeah!

414
01:10:51.552 --> 01:10:52.417
Next

415
01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:06.032
My 30 year's practice

416
01:11:06.467 --> 01:11:08.332
is useful now

417
01:11:10.104 --> 01:11:10.900
Get ready

418
01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:16.643
Do you want to kill
a martial arts hero as me?

419
01:11:17.077 --> 01:11:17.975
Not that easy

420
01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:47.507
Ready

421
01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:55.404
Execution now

422
01:12:00.255 --> 01:12:03.884
Take this container to
the boundary in 30 minutes

423
01:12:04.259 --> 01:12:05.247
The buyer is waiting

424
01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:06.422
Yes

425
01:12:07.295 --> 01:12:08.023
More

426
01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:18.235
Your buyer was killed

427
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.807
Now the skull is none
of your business

428
01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:22.801
We will send it back to
Zhen Yang by ourselves

429
01:12:24.412 --> 01:12:26.676
Surrender now

430
01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:28.542
Or you will be killed

431
01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:30.012
Man with a golden gun

432
01:12:30.484 --> 01:12:32.975
I've caught your fellows

433
01:12:33.488 --> 01:12:34.978
You'd better surrender now

434
01:12:43.765 --> 01:12:46.063
Damn!

435
01:12:48.636 --> 01:12:49.534
You claim yourself a man

436
01:12:50.171 --> 01:12:51.159
Luckily I've wore bullet proof vest

437
01:12:51.972 --> 01:12:52.836
I shouldn't have risked
my life for you

438
01:12:53.007 --> 01:12:54.838
You didn't say a word
but just beat me?

439
01:12:55.409 --> 01:12:57.570
You want to beat me?
Beat him!

440
01:13:20.234 --> 01:13:21.202
I'm forced to be a betrayer

441
01:13:21.636 --> 01:13:22.500
I co-operate with you

442
01:13:23.203 --> 01:13:24.534
I know where he is
Follow me

443
01:13:56.805 --> 01:13:58.295
Come on, I'm waiting for you

444
01:13:58.672 --> 01:14:00.105
Be careful. Go away

445
01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.270
I can shoot you to
death this time

446
01:14:29.237 --> 01:14:31.204
Stop looking!
Use our powerful stance!

447
01:14:36.211 --> 01:14:38.235
High temperature flame!

448
01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:39.203
I don't believe your armour

449
01:14:39.381 --> 01:14:42.009
can stand the High
temperature flame

450
01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:46.516
Shit! I'm sorry!

451
01:14:46.988 --> 01:14:48.353
I used up the gas last night!

452
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:50.122
Sorry for not informing you

453
01:14:50.425 --> 01:14:51.585
Sorry, real sorry!

454
01:14:58.766 --> 01:15:00.359
Playing ball?
I'll blow it off

455
01:15:00.534 --> 01:15:01.832
Your turn now

456
01:15:03.938 --> 01:15:05.166
Don't forget me!

457
01:15:06.807 --> 01:15:09.503
Wonder Fist!

458
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:44.371
I shouldn't have provided
you good living

459
01:15:44.746 --> 01:15:47.578
You betrayed me for
a pork vendor!

460
01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:55.378
Chai's just been killed

461
01:15:55.789 --> 01:15:56.814
You loved him?

462
01:15:57.591 --> 01:15:59.617
I'll send you to hell with him

463
01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:02.760
Chai!

464
01:16:08.002 --> 01:16:09.730
I know your trick!

465
01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:13.934
If yes, why didn't you
tell me beforehand?

466
01:16:14.943 --> 01:16:15.738
Ling Ling Chai

467
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:17.335
Chai, are you alright?

468
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:18.542
Alright, I am fine

469
01:16:18.846 --> 01:16:20.314
Please don't say official lines

470
01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:22.280
Aren't you executed?

471
01:16:22.984 --> 01:16:24.076
I am so mad about this!

472
01:16:24.252 --> 01:16:25.844
You made me lose one hundred!

473
01:16:44.372 --> 01:16:45.497
Out

474
01:16:57.985 --> 01:17:00.113
Bad boss, bad fellows

475
01:17:00.555 --> 01:17:02.386
I can't imagine your fellows
are more greedy than you

476
01:17:02.856 --> 01:17:03.823
What a shame to stand
in front of the words

477
01:17:03.992 --> 01:17:05.960
"Faithful to our country"

478
01:17:06.327 --> 01:17:08.420
If you, the nasty evil,
still exist in China,

479
01:17:08.729 --> 01:17:10.458
our people won't have better lives

480
01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:12.899
I have to kill you now

481
01:17:13.467 --> 01:17:14.798
Don't you think you
trash can kill me?

482
01:17:14.969 --> 01:17:16.060
Trash?

483
01:17:17.305 --> 01:17:18.271
I used up all my days

484
01:17:18.439 --> 01:17:20.304
to invent this

485
01:17:20.675 --> 01:17:22.574
"Super Weapon",
product serial Killing 3000

486
01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:26.639
It's combined by 10 killing
weapons. Now, it's done

487
01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:27.872
Chai, step aside

488
01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:29.144
Far away

489
01:17:29.617 --> 01:17:30.548
Far far away!

490
01:17:31.452 --> 01:17:32.247
Really?

491
01:17:33.154 --> 01:17:34.484
I wish to see it

492
01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.082
Killing 3000

493
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:39.885
Knife

494
01:17:40.228 --> 01:17:40.886
Bicycle chain

495
01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:41.989
Fire powder

496
01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:42.988
Acid

497
01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:43.891
Drugs

498
01:17:44.065 --> 01:17:44.655
Gun

499
01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:45.354
Grenade

500
01:17:45.532 --> 01:17:46.396
Triangle sharpener

501
01:17:46.568 --> 01:17:47.761
Every kinds of weapon can kill

502
01:17:47.935 --> 01:17:49.266
Now, it's combined into one

503
01:17:50.238 --> 01:17:51.431
Are you scared?

504
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.574
You nuts!
You should have been killed

505
01:17:55.042 --> 01:17:55.872
Wait

506
01:18:00.047 --> 01:18:00.877
Man Si

507
01:18:01.248 --> 01:18:02.773
Chai, I depend on you

508
01:18:10.057 --> 01:18:11.286
Well, I've no other choice

509
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:15.122
I have to fight alone

510
01:18:18.765 --> 01:18:19.755
Butcher's knife?

511
01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:32.307
Butcher's knife

512
01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:55.166
No!

513
01:19:29.636 --> 01:19:33.073
Bastard! Let me see
how powerful you are

514
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.238
I will let you see my power

515
01:19:35.877 --> 01:19:36.934
Damn you!

516
01:19:58.199 --> 01:19:59.166
What kind of knife is it?

517
01:20:00.134 --> 01:20:01.032
Butcher's knife

518
01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:02.627
It's used to kill beast!

519
01:20:54.654 --> 01:20:56.350
Give me $5 pork please

520
01:21:00.261 --> 01:21:00.954
My stall is temporarily closed

521
01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:02.460
come back an hour later

522
01:21:02.829 --> 01:21:03.693
Can you waste an hour for that?

523
01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:05.833
I don't think you need more
than 3 minutes

524
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.398
3 hours are not enough
for me instead!

525
01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:09.760
Chai, let's go home

526
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:11.128
Don't waste any time

527
01:21:11.271 --> 01:21:12.033
And this place is nice

528
01:21:12.206 --> 01:21:13.467
Damn!

529
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:23.309
Chai, it's a shit!

530
01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:26.181
Our spy satellite
is lost in the space

531
01:21:26.753 --> 01:21:27.778
It's related to the safety

532
01:21:27.954 --> 01:21:29.354
of our country

533
01:21:29.523 --> 01:21:30.615
Now, I am newly promoted

534
01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:32.259
don't you want me to have trouble?

535
01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:34.027
Come back and help me

536
01:21:35.095 --> 01:21:36.221
I am now dealing some
loving affairs with my girl

537
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.020
About the country, that's peanut,
just forget it

538
01:21:38.166 --> 01:21:38.894
